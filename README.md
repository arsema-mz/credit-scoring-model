# Credit Risk Scoring with Alternative Data

This project delivers a **decision-support tool** for assessing credit risk using **alternative data sources** (such as telecom and transaction data). Designed for a finance-sector audience, it demonstrates how modern data science can **improve risk management** while remaining **transparent, auditable, and regulator-friendly**.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Traditional credit scores often exclude customers without formal financial histories. This tool provides financial institutions with a way to:

* **Expand credit access** by using alternative data signals.
* **Maintain transparency** in how risk is assessed, satisfying Basel II–style regulatory requirements.
* **Balance performance and interpretability**, ensuring both reliable predictions and explainable results.

## 💡 Business Impact

* **Better portfolio management**: Identify high-risk customers before loan approval.
* **Reduced default rates**: Predict repayment risk more accurately than rule-based systems.
* **Financial inclusion**: Enable lending to underbanked populations without traditional credit files.

## 🛠️ Key Features

* **Risk Prediction Models**

  * Logistic Regression (transparent, regulator-friendly).
  * Random Forest (stronger predictive performance).
* **Explainability & Trust**

  * SHAP-based explainability to show “why” a decision was made.
* **Interactive Tools**

  * REST API (FastAPI) for easy integration.
  * Planned Streamlit dashboard for business users (no coding required).
* **Robust Engineering**

  * Modular pipeline for data processing and training.
  * Automated testing & CI/CD for reliability.
  * Containerized deployment (Docker-ready).

## 🔒 Why This Matters for Finance

Financial institutions face a trade-off:

* Simple models are **clear and auditable** but less powerful.
* Complex models are **powerful** but often **black boxes**.

This project shows how both can work together:

* **Logistic Regression** → for compliance & audit trails.
* **Random Forest** → for internal risk management, supported by explainability tools.

## 📊 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Preparation** → Raw data is cleaned, transformed, and enriched with behavioral features.
2. **Risk Labeling** → Proxy default variable created using clustering and repayment behavior.
3. **Model Training** → Multiple models trained and tuned; best versions saved.
4. **Deployment** → Models exposed via an API and prepared for a user-facing dashboard.
5. **Explainability** → Visual explanations clarify why a customer was flagged as high risk.


## 🚀 Next Steps

The following items will be addressed in the final phase of the project:

* **Interactive Dashboard**

  * Build a **Streamlit-based dashboard** for business users.
  * Display model predictions, customer risk scores, and SHAP explanations in a clear, visual format.
  * Add filtering and drill-down capabilities (e.g., by region, customer type).

* **Enhanced Deployment**

  * Connect the FastAPI backend with the dashboard.
  * Containerize the full system (API + dashboard) for easy deployment.
  * Explore deployment to a cloud service (AWS/GCP/Azure).

* **Model Monitoring & Updates**

  * Add metrics to monitor **model drift** and performance over time.
  * Set up automated retraining pipelines if new data becomes available.

* **Business Validation**

  * Simulate portfolio-level outcomes (e.g., expected default reduction).
  * Engage in a “what-if” analysis to show impact on lending decisions.
